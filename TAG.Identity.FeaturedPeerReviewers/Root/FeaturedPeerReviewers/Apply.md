Apply to become a Featured Peer Reviewer
--------------------------------------------

On this page you can apply to become a featured peer reviewer. This means that you will be presented as a peer reviewer for new
users in your area, to help them review their identity applications and approve them.

To become a featured peer reviewer, you need to scan the QR-code below using your TAG ID app, or variant. Once
you have done that, and approved the request to log in, your information will be presented on the page. There you can provide the
local details you wish to provide, in what country, region, city, area or postal code you wish your identity will be presented
as a peer reviewer. When you are done, you can submit your application. The operator will receive a notification. If the operator
approves you, your information will be presented to new users in the location you've selected. If a new user requests a peer
review from you, you will receive a push notification in your app.

**Note**: Your photo will become publicly available to new users, together with your name and the information about the location
you provide peer review services. You can at any time, [remove](Remove.md) your identity from the list of featured peer reviewers.
